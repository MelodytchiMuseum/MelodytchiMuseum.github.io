# Welcome
My name is Colton Burdick. I am currently 23 years old. I graduated from Mansfield University of Pennsylvania in May of 2017, getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. On this small site, you can view some of the programming projects I have done throughout my college career to get an idea of what I am capable of. The projects are sorted starting with the most recent project, and going further back into my college career. Note that these are, by far, not all the projects I have completed during my college career. Unfortunately, some projects had been lost. Others I did not feel were a decent enough to showcase my programming skills.

## TamaHotel
**Languages used**: JavaScript, HTML, HTML5
**Development Period**: April 2017 to May 2017

TamaHotel is a JavaScript game that utilizes the HTML5 canvas. I developed it as the final project for my Advanced Web Design class in my final semester. It received much praise and had even been voted "Best Project" by many people (the professor required us to vote for 2 "Best Projects").

The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand. The player must take care of their hotel guests by responding to their requests and ensuring their rooms are kept clean. If a guest asks for a meal, the player must give them a meal before their request times out. Players must also regularly give each guest new bedsheets and empty each guest's trash bin. At 1 PM (game time) every day, a new guest enters the hotel; the guest that appears is based on how well the player took care of their guests on the previous day. The player wins if they manage to keep a full hotel for 24 hours (game time). However, the player loses if 3 guests leave. A guest will leave if their requests are not responded to 3 times; this includes "silent requests" like changing bedsheets or emptying trash bins. Assuming no guests leave, a full game can take an hour to complete.

## "Mero Game"
**Languages used**: JavaScript, HTML, HTML5
**Development Period**: March 2017
![Image](MelodytchiMuseum.github.io/scr/merogame.png)

This nameless game is tiny and was put together in just 3 hours for an Advanced Web Design assignment. Like TamaHotel, it was programmed in JavaScript and utilizes the HTML5 canvas. In it, the player simply has to collect blue music notes while avoiding red music notes. There is not much depth or variety to the gameplay, nor is there an end as it was only done as a small assignment. This was, however, my first time using the HTML5 canvas.

## SQL Database
**Languages used**: SQL
**Development Period**: April 2016
This SQL database was created as my term project for a Database Systems class. Though it was a group project, I myself had laid down the groundwork for the database as I was working alone before I was put into a group by the professor. The professor had instructed us to use my database for the project. I planned out the database and created the tables. Some of the table population was done by me as well. There are also 3 "complex" queries at the end of the file that I had programmed, as each group needed to program 10 total (my partners' queries are not in this file).

## Awesomacro
**Languages used**: C#
**Development Period**: February 2016
This is a text macro I had actually created in my spare time, rather than being made as a class project. Despite this, it utilizes C#, so I figured I should use it in my portfolio anyway. This utility simply loads Responses.txt locally and adds each line in the file to a list of "responses". Upon pressing the `INSERT` key, the macro randomly chooses a response and immediately types it out for the user and attempts to send it as a message. Created with a specific game in mind, it simulates a combination `ENTER + SHIFT` key press before typing out the message, then an `ENTER` key press after finishing typing. It utilizes the **InputSimulator** library, made by Michael Noonan.

## Colton's Mediocre Movie Theater
**Languages used**: HTML, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
**Development Period**: December 2015
This is a somewhat simple HTML website that utilized CSS for consistent styling between pages developed as the final project for my Web Design class (preceeding the Advanced Web Design class). Minimal use of JavaScript code is also featured on the website. The website simply provides information for a small, fictional movie theater. As per the professor's instructions, the "About" page features information regarding the planning and development of the website.

## Colton's Castle
**Languages used**: HTML, CSS
**Development Period**: October 2015
This is another simple HTML website that also utilized CSS to keep the style consistent between pages. It was developed as a midterm project for my Web Design class. This website is functionally simpler than the previous website, as it was created earlier in that semester. The website simply provides information on games I had worked on at one point (but never finished) and provided information about said games. The website treats each game as a finished game, though this is not actually the case and none of the games can be downloaded. Similar to the previous website, the "About" page displays information about the development of the website.

## Risk Map
**Languages used**: C#
**Development Period**: February 2014 to May 2014
This is my contribution to the term project in one of my Computer Science classes in the Spring 2014 semester. The class involved all of the students working together as a team to recreate the board game Risk as a computer game with online multiplayer and custom maps. The project was all programmed in C#. More details can be found in the repository's readme.

## Candyland
**Languages used**: Java
**Development Period**: December 2013
This is a small recreation of the Candyland board game. It was programmed entirely by me in Java. I had been developing it as a backup plan in the event the initially planned project would not work properly. Said project was developed as my partner and I's term project for a Computer Sceince class in the Fall 2013 semester. Though the initial project ended up working and this project went unused, I included it in my portfolio as I had programmed the entirety of this project myself. Though I had not tested it before uploading it, I recall it working just fine. However, it lacks a GUI and must be played through command line.

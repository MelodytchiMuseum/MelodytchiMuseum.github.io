# Hello!
My name is Colton Burdick. I am currently 23 years old. I graduated from Mansfield University of Pennsylvania in May of 2017, getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. On this small site, you can view some of the programming projects I have done throughout my college career to get an idea of what I am capable of. The projects are sorted starting with the most recent project, and going further back into my college career.

## TamaHotel

TamaHotel is a **JavaScript** game that utilizes the **HTML5 canvas**. I developed it as the final project for my Advanced Web Design class in my final semester. It received much praise and had even been voted "Best Project" by many people (the professor required us to vote for 2 "Best Projects").

The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand. The player must take care of their hotel guests by responding to their requests and ensuring their rooms are kept clean. If a guest asks for a meal, the player must give them a meal before their request times out. Players must also regularly give each guest new bedsheets and empty each guest's trash bin. At 1 PM (game time) every day, a new guest enters the hotel; the guest that appears is based on how well the player took care of their guests on the previous day. The player wins if they manage to keep a full hotel for 24 hours (game time). However, the player loses if 3 guests leave. A guest will leave if their requests are not responded to 3 times; this includes "silent requests" like changing bedsheets or emptying trash bins. Assuming no guests leave, a full game can take an hour to complete.

## "Mero Game"

This nameless game is tiny and was put together in just 3 hours for an Advanced Web Design assignment. Like TamaHotel, it was programmed in **JavaScript** and utilizes the **HTML5 canvas**. In it, the player simply has to collect blue music notes while avoiding red music notes. There is not much depth or variety to the gameplay, nor is there an end as it was only done as a small assignment. This was, however, my first time using the HTML5 canvas.

## SQL Database
This **SQL** database was created as my term project for a Database Systems class. Though it was a group project, I myself had laid down the groundwork for the database as I was working alone before I was put into a group by the professor. The professor had instructed us to use my database for the project. I planned out the database and created the tables. Some of the table population was done by me as well. There are also 3 "complex" queries at the end of the file that I had programmed, as each group needed to program 10 total (my partners' queries are not in this file).

## Awesomacro

This is a text macro I had actually created in my spare time, rather than being made as a class project. Despite this, it utilizes **C#**, so I figured I should use it in my portfolio anyway. This utility simply loads Responses.txt locally and adds each line in the file to a list of "responses". Upon pressing the `INSERT` key, the macro randomly chooses a response and immediately types it out for the user and attempts to send it as a message. Created with a specific game in mind, it simulates a combination `ENTER + SHIFT` key press before typing out the message, then an `ENTER` key press after finishing typing. It utilizes the **InputSimulator** library, made by Michael Noonan.

## Risk Map
This is my contribution to the term project in one of my Computer Science classes in the Spring 2014 semester. The class involved all of the students working together as a team to recreate the board game Risk as a computer game with online multiplayer and custom maps. The project was all programmed in **C#**. More details can be foudn in the repository's readme.

## Candyland
This is a small recreation of the Candyland board game. It was programmed entirely by me in **Java**. I had been developing it as a backup plan in the event the initially planned project would not work properly. Said project was developed as my partner and I's term project for a Computer Sceince class in the Fall 2013 semester. Though the initial project ended up working and this project went unused, I included it in my portfolio as I had programmed the entirety of this project myself. Though I had not tested it before uploading it, I recall it working just fine. However, it lacks a GUI and must be played through command line.

# Hello!
My name is Colton Burdick. I am currently 23 years old. I graduated from Mansfield University of Pennsylvania in May of 2017, getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. On this small site, you can view some of the programming projects I have done throughout my college career to get an idea of what I am capable of.

## TamaHotel

TamaHotel is a JavaScript game that utilizes the HTML5 canvas. I developed it as the final project for my Advanced Web Design class in my final semester. It received much praise and had even been voted "Best Project" by many people (the professor required us to vote for 2 "Best Projects").

The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand. The player must take care of their hotel guests by responding to their requests and ensuring their rooms are kept clean. If a guest asks for a meal, the player must give them a meal before their request times out. Players must also regularly give each guest new bedsheets and empty each guest's trash bin. At 1 PM (game time) every day, a new guest enters the hotel; the guest that appears is based on how well the player took care of their guests on the previous day. The player wins if they manage to keep a full hotel for 24 hours (game time). However, the player loses if 3 guests leave. A guest will leave if their requests are not responded to 3 times; this includes "silent requests" like changing bedsheets or emptying trash bins. Assuming no guests leave, a full game can take an hour to complete.

## "Mero Game"

This nameless game is tiny and was put together in just 3 hours for an Advanced Web Design assignment. Like TamaHotel, it was programmed in JavaScript and utilizes the HTML5 canvas. In it, the player simply has to collect blue music notes while avoiding red music notes. There is not much depth or variety to the gameplay, nor is there an end as it was only done as a small assignment. This was, however, my first time using the HTML5 canvas.
